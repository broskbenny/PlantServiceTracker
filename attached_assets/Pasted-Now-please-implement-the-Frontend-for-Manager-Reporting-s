Now, please implement the Frontend for Manager Reporting, specifically the 'Completed Jobs History' report. This will allow managers to get an overview of work performed.
This should involve:
New Page/Section for Reports (Manager Dashboard):
Create a new page (e.g., ManagerReports.tsx or similar) accessible from the Manager's sidebar navigation (e.g., under a "Reports" menu item).
Report Filters:
On this page, provide UI elements for managers to filter the completed jobs report. The filters we discussed were:
Date Range: Two date pickers (From Date, To Date).
Service Staff Member: A dropdown list populated with the service staff managed by the logged-in manager (fetched from an endpoint like GET /api/v1/manager/staff if not already available client-side). Allow an "All Staff" option.
Customer: A dropdown or searchable select list populated with customers (fetched from GET /api/v1/manager/customers). Allow an "All Customers" option.
A "Generate Report" or "Apply Filters" button.
Report Display Area:
Below the filters, display the report results, ideally in a clear table format.
When the manager applies the filters, the frontend should make a request to the backend API endpoint: GET /api/v1/manager/reports/completed-jobs using the selected filter values as query parameters (e.g., ?date_from=...&date_to=...&staff_id=...&customer_id=...).
The table should display key information for each completed job returned by the API, such as:
Customer Name
Job Address (or just city for brevity if needed)
Date of Completion
Service Staff Member who completed it
(Optional) A link to view the full job details.
Handling No Results:
If the selected filters return no completed jobs, display a user-friendly message (e.g., "No completed jobs found for the selected criteria.").
Loading State:
Display a loading indicator while the report data is being fetched from the API.
This feature will provide managers with valuable insights into completed work and staff performance."
Key considerations for this implementation:
Date Pickers: The AI will need to use or implement date picker components for the date range filter.
Dropdown Population: Fetching and populating the staff and customer dropdowns efficiently.
API Call Construction: Correctly constructing the API request URL with the selected filter parameters.
Data Presentation: Ensuring the report table is readable and presents the information clearly.
This will add another important piece of functionality for the managers, helping them track progress and history.
