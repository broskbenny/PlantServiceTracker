Yes, please proceed with implementing the recurring patterns (recurring jobs/series) in the database next. This should include:
Ensuring the RecurringPatterns (or RecurringSeries) table is correctly defined in the database schema with all necessary fields (frequency, interval, start/end conditions, link to a template job, etc.) as we discussed.
Implementing the backend logic and API endpoints for managers to:
Create new recurring job series (defining the pattern and the template job details).
View existing recurring series.
Edit existing recurring series (both the pattern and the template job).
Delete recurring series.
Implementing the backend logic that will generate the actual job instances based on these recurring patterns. (Consider how and when these instances are generated - e.g., a daily/weekly script, or on-demand when a manager views a future date).
Ensuring that individual job instances generated from a recurring series are correctly linked back to their parent recurring pattern.
This is a crucial piece of functionality."
Additional observations and potential next steps after recurring jobs:
iCal Feed: Once jobs (including recurring ones) are well-established, implementing the iCal feed for service staff would be a good next feature.
"Items Requiring Attention" / Manager Notifications: The messaging system is there, but the specific view for managers to see flagged items needs to be built out on the frontend and backed by the appropriate API query.
Frontend Polish & UX: After core backend logic is in, iterating on the frontend UI/UX for clarity, ease of use, and responsiveness will be important. The AI used React, which is different from our "vanilla JS" plan but is a powerful choice. You'll need to familiarize yourself with how it structures components if you plan to modify the frontend yourself.
Detailed Hierarchical View: Ensure the frontend properly displays and allows interaction with the Job -> Group -> Service Point hierarchy.
Testing: Thoroughly test all CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for each entity and user flow.
